# Text Message Emotion Predictor

## Description
This is a personal project that uses a dataset from **Kaggle** to create a machine learning model that is used as the basis of a text message emotion predictor. Although this is not my first project creating a ML model, it is my first project using Flask to utilise the model.

## Tech Stack
I used **Jupyter** to train and test the model using **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Flask** in **Python** to create the web app.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to familiarise myself with using git, convert my ML model into a functioning web app using Flask and deploying it on a cloud platform such as Heroku used in this project.

## The dataset used in this project can be found below.
