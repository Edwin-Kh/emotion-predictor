Text Message Emotion Predictor

This is a personal project that uses a dataset from Kaggle to create a machine learning model that is used as the basis of a text message emotion predictor.
I used Jupyter to train and test the model using Multinomial Naive Bayes and Flask to create the web app. Although this is not my first project creating a ML model, it is my first project using Flask to utilise the model.

The dataset used in this project can be found below.
